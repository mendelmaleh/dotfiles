### idle configuration
#
# example configuration:
#
# exec swayidle -w \
#          timeout 300 'swaylock -f -c 000000' \
#          timeout 600 'swaymsg "output * dpms off"' resume 'swaymsg "output * dpms on"' \
#          before-sleep 'swaylock -f -c 000000'
#
# this will lock your screen after 300 seconds of inactivity, then turn off
# your displays after another 300 seconds, and turn your screens back on when
# resumed. it will also lock your screen before your computer goes to sleep.
